# Project Title: AI-Powered Stock Predictor
## Description
This project is an AI-powered stock prediction web application. It uses machine learning models to forecast stock prices,
employing Python for data analysis and machine learning,
SQL for data storage.
JavaScript, Flask, HTML, and CSS is used to create a simple lightweight web interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For AI model development and backend logic. Some of the main libraries used are
- **psycopg2** For interaction with our PostgreSQL database
 **pandas,numpy** Standard data processing and data manipulation
 **, sklearn, ,Pytorch** Machine learning and optimization
- **Yahoo finance API**: To  retrieve stock data.
- **SQL**: To store stock data in a secure way with fast acces to be used for training our model ( Mostly just to familirize with sql and transactions)
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity to the web pages.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.

 Each stock is evaluted based on a model developed with a recurrant neural network whih utilizes past performance to predict next day performance.
 
## Disclaimer
this is solely a for fun project and stocks were chosen mainly in order have 
access to large datasets for our training data.
